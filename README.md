**Matlab example of Markov Chain with N agents**
In this simple example a Markov Chain is implemented considering N agents. 
The length of the simulation is set along with the number of agents that comes into play. 
The agent in this example refers to the number of people in the zone. 
This code enable the stocastic estimation of the number of people into a specific zone based on the transitional matrix. 
The transitional matrix can be further extended in order to embed the real transition probabilities of different steps (at the moment we are using proxy values).
